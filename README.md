# **About** ðŸŒŸ

## *My journey into the world of discrete mathematics began unexpectedly.* 

While attending classes in the *Applied Mathematics and Information Science* program(goshhh I feel so happy when attending it! Out of all the lectures, I feel most like myself)â€”outside of my primary facultyâ€”I realized just how deeply passionate I am about integrating mathematical theories into programming and machine learning. ðŸ¦„âœ¨

These classes have sparked new ideas on how theoretical math concepts can solve practical problems in algorithm design, optimization, and data structures, fueling my desire to dive deeper into this intersection of fields.
