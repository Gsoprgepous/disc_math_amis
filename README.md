# **About** ðŸŒŸ

While attending classes in the *Applied Mathematics and Information Science* program â€” outside of my primary faculty â€” I realized just how deeply passionate I am about integrating mathematical theories into programming and machine learning ðŸ¦„âœ¨

These classes have sparked new ideas on how theoretical math concepts can solve practical problems in algorithm design, optimization, and data structures, fueling my desire to dive deeper into this intersection of fields.
